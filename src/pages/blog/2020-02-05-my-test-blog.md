I’m looking at porn with a woman I met on the internet.

To the left of our Skype video chat, a checkerboard of video stills merge into one single disingenuous orgasm. Bodies grind and groan in their windows, holding positions with dexterous ease. As we scroll and browse the various clips, animated porno Gifs bounce irritatingly in the margins of the screen, trying to catch our gaze.

“Pornhub wants us to come here, open up a video, open up another, and lose our afternoon Vegas-style,” says Missy Kelley, the woman I’ve just met. Kelley is a UX and AI product design director who I connected with via email. She’s recently updated the[Make Love Not Porn](https://www.makelovenotporn.com/)website, the “social sex” video-sharing platform spearheaded by Cindy Gallop and brought into public consciousness after her[2009 TED Talk went viral](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FV8n_E_6Tpc). I figure Kelley has something to say about the interface design of popular sex sites, which,

according to most current web-design lore, are chaotic and poorly designed. “Sites like Pornhub obviously want to monitor our engagement by providing one dopamine hit after another. It’s all about fast consumption and clicks,” says Kelley.

If we side with the popular opinion that minimal, stripped-back interfaces improve user experience, a black background with bright orange Arial and a swirl of animated sidebars advertising lonely, local MILFs is not the stuff effective web design is made of. Yet it’s no coincidence that Pornhub, xTube, RedTube, YouPorn, xVideos, xHamster, and more all feature very similar interfaces. What appears under-designed is in fact highly strategic.
